Please remove the "admin_extra" folder from application/modules/. It has been merged with the "admin" module, and keeping both will cause duplicates and outdated admin tools.<br /><br />The following config files have been changed and must be re-configured if you previously have done any changes via the admin panel dashboard (in the list of modules) after the update has been installed;<br />
<ul>
	<li>News config</li>
	<li>Register config (forum bridge)</li>
	<li>Vote config</li>
</ul>
